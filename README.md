Home Locker System 
project is an innovative solution designed to address the 
growing need for secure, convenient, and interactive storage options within residential 
environments. As online shopping and home delivery services continue to surge, the 
necessity for a reliable method to store packages, personal belongings, and valuable items 
has become critical. This system aims to bridge the gap between traditional storage 
solutions and the emerging trend of smart home automation. 
The Home Locker System integrates various technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) 
and role-based access control to provide users with a secure and user-friendly platform. 
The system allows users to open, lock, reserve, and monitor lockers remotely through a 
mobile interface. Additionally, it includes essential security features like login 
authentication, activity logging, and an auto-logout function to ensure that the system 
remains protected from unauthorized access. 
Key features of the system include multi-user authentication, where admins have control 
over all lockers, and normal users are restricted to their assigned lockers. The activity log 
module tracks all interactions with the lockers, providing an audit trail for security 
purposes. The reservation timer locks a locker temporarily to simulate real-world 
reservation behavior, while the auto-logout security module ensures that the system 
automatically logs out inactive users after five minutes.
